	<h1>The Miracle of 1998</h1>
	<p>  After the baby was born and ensured a Yankees win of game 1, they rallied in the 7th inning and procceeded to win. There was still 3 games remaining before they would be crowned as World Champions but they believed in the Yankee baby's words. The yankees just had to hold up their end of the bargain.

		<p> As the following 3 games approached the Yankees Players felt very positive in the results of the series considering the Yankee baby guaranteed a game 1 win and that is what happened. They came out red hot in the following 3 games and won the World Series. The Baby was assigned personal seats along with his parents in the Yankee dugout during these games as a good luck charm, and indeed he was. Before every inning the players would all rub his head and swore this baby had some sort of powers because it always worked.
