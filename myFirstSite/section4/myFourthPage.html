	<h1>The After Math</h1>

	<p> 


	
	<p> After winning the '98 World Series, The Yankees proceeded to complete what is known today as the '3Peat'. After these straight wins they knew where the luck was from. It was the Yankee Baby! It was the miracle of this powerful child that was born the night of the 1st game of the World Series. Instead of taking advantage of this baby they decided to mentor the child and help him use him powers for good in baseball. They officially pronounced that this miracle Yankee child "Had The Power!"
