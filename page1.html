	<p> Born during Game 1 of the NYC World Series, it was not only special for the child but for the team. As the known baseball song "Take Me Out To The Ball Game" played, the NYC Yankee team was helping deliver this baby. Since they participated in helping they designated this baby as The Yankee Baby.
